## Here we would like to add some controllers in order to ask the user to select the parameters of the ride

1. Let's ask for:
- date and time
- pickup longitude
- pickup latitude
- dropoff longitude
- dropoff latitude
- passenger count
'''
date = st.date_input("Date of Travel")
time = st.time_input("Time of Travel")
pickup_longitude = st.number_input("Pickup Longitude")
pickup_latitude = st.number_input("Pickup Latitude")
dropoff_longitude = st.number_input("Dropoff Longitude")
dropoff_latitude = st.number_input("Dropoff Latitude")
passenger_count = st.slider("Number of Passengers", 1, 10)

## Once we have these, let's call our API in order to retrieve a prediction

See ? No need to load a `model.joblib` file in this app, we do not even need to know anything about Data Science in order to retrieve a prediction...

🤔 How could we call our API ? Off course... The `requests` package 💡
'''

url = 'https://taxifare.lewagon.ai/predict'

if url == 'https://taxifare.lewagon.ai/predict':

    st.markdown('Maybe you want to use your own API for the prediction, not the one provided by Le Wagon...')

'''

2. Let's build a dictionary containing the parameters for our API...
'''
diccy = pd.DataFrame()
'''
3. Let's call our API using the `requests` package...

4. Let's retrieve the prediction from the **JSON** returned by the API...

## Finally, we can display the prediction to the user
